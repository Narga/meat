 General options:

                          comma-separated list of packages. may be used more
                          than once
      --ignore PKG        ignore PKG when upgrading. PKG is a comma-separated
                          list of packages. may be used more than once
      --ignorerepo REPO   ignore a binary repo. REPO is a comma-separated list

      --nossl             do not use https connections
      --sign              sign the resulting packages with gpg. overrides the

      --threads NUM       limit number of threads created to NUM
      --timeout NUM       specify connection timeout in seconds
      --check-all         when installing, prompts you to check every regular
                          file in the package directory instead of just the
